# ✈️ Airline Email Search

This repository provides tools to search for airline contact emails using two approaches:
1. **Selenium-based search** (`search_selenium.py`): Uses a browser automation framework to extract emails from webpages.
2. **Google Search library-based search** (`search_googlesearch.py`): Leverages the `googlesearch` Python library to locate and extract emails from search results.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd airline-email-search

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Note  
This tool can also be repurposed to extract contact emails for any company, not just airlines.
